This GRB has little to no BGO data and only 1 LAT bin.  No LLE data.  Not worth doing 3 component models.

*** No power law is every going to be stable since the high-energy data is bad.
*** This GRB can be skipped for time-resolved analysis.


grbm, sbpl:  both have good fits and errors.

lpow:  not the best but good.

copl:  not the best due to the one LAT data point.  but not bad.  has errors.

copl+lpow:  couldn't get errors.  not stable enough.

grbm+lpow:  power-law keeps moving steeper and steeper.

sbpl+lpow:  angle of PL makes it useless.  Simple model is best for this grb.  This is a NO.

blackb+lpow:  got good fit and errors.

grbm+blackb:  only 1 sigma errors possible.

sbpl+blackb:  similar to grbm+bb but not the best errors.

copl+blackb:  worked. I think errors were good good.
